   <h1>Computer Architecture</h1>
   <hr>

      <span>Opinion</span>
      A computer, at its core, is an electric circuit that 
      takes in only certain kind of inputs. It gives out well-defined
      outputs for each of these inputs. 
      The collection of all valid inputs of a particular circuit, and abstract 
      details of its execution constitute the <strong>Instruction Set Architecture</strong>.

      <span>Definition</span>
      <strong>Instruction set:</strong> The vocabulary of commands understood by an architecture.
   </p>

   <p>
      <span>Definition</span>
      <strong>Stored-program concept:</strong> The idea that instructions and data of many types can be stored in
      memory as numbers and thus be easy to change, leading to the
      stored-program computer.

      <span>Definition</span>
      <strong>Doubleword:</strong>Another natural unit of access in a computer, 
      usually a group of 64 bits; corresponds to the size of a register in the 
      RISC-V architecture.<br><br>
      <strong>Word:</strong>A natural unit of access in a computer, usually a group of 32 bits.
   </p>

   <p>
      <span>Opinion</span>
      The principle behind having just 32 registers is <em>Smaller is Faster.</em> 
      Having 32 registers makes it easier to assign bits to denote registers in the instruction,
      which sounds like a more plausible reason. 
   </p>

   <p>
      <span>Note</span>
      Registers in RISC-V architecture are denoted with <em>x</em> followed
      the number of that register.
      To keep things simple, all addresses and integers in these notes are considered
      to be 64 bits long.

      <span>Definition</span>
      <strong>Data transfer instruction:</strong> A command that moves data between memory and registers.<br/><br>
      <strong>address:</strong> A value used to delineate the location of a specific data element
      within a memory array.

      <ol>Overview of instructions read till now:
         <li>
            <code>add rd, rs1, rs2</code><br>
         </li>
         <li>
            <code>sub rd, rs1, rs2</code><br>
         </li>
         <li>
            <code>ld r1, i(r2)</code><br>
            Here, the sum of <code>r2</code> and <code>i</code> forms the memory
            address. <code>ld</code> stands for <em>load doubleword</em>.
            <code>r2</code> and <code>i</code> are called the <em>base register</em> 
            and <em>offset</em>, respectively. 
         </li>
         <li>
            <code>sd r1, i(r2)</code><br>
            The <code>sd</code>, <em>store doubleword</em>, instruction is 
            the counterpart to <em>load doubleword</em>.
         </li>
         <li>
            <code>addi rd, rs, i</code><br>
            This instruction is in alingment with the idea of making <strong>common case fast</strong>.
            Also, there is no <code>subi</code> since <code>i</code> can be any integer.
         </li>
      
      </ol>

      <span>Byte addressing</span>
      <img src="assets/byte-addressing.png" alt="image depicting byte-addressing">
      Since 8-bit bytes are useful in many programs, virtually all
      architectures today address individual bytes.Therefore, the
      address of a doubleword matches the address of one of the 8 bytes
      within the doubleword, and addresses of sequential doublewords
      differ by 8.
      Therefore, the address of a doubleword matches the address of 
      one of the 8 bytes within the doubleword, and addresses of sequential 
      doublewords differ by 8.

   <p>
      <span>Info</span>
      The compiler tries to keep the most frequently used variables in 
      registers and places the rest in memory, using loads and stores 
      to move variables between registers and memory. The process of putting 
      less frequently used variables (or those needed later) into memory 
      is called <em>spilling</em> registers.<br/>
      A RISC-V arithmetic instruction can read two registers, operate on 
      them, and write the result. A RISC-V data transfer instruction only 
      reads one operand or writes one operand, without operating on it.
   </p>

   <p>
      <span>Info</span>
      Zero has a dedicated register, x0.
   </p>

   <div class="numbering-system">
      <span>Signed and Unsigned numbering</span>
      The bits in a <em>doubleword</em> are numbered corresponding to the power
      of the base for that bit.<br>
      In a doubleword, the <strong>most significant bit</strong> and <strong>least significant bit</strong>
      refer to bit number <code>63</code> and <code>0</code>, respectively. <br>

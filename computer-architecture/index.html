   <h1>Computer Architecture</h1>

      <span>Opinion</span>
      A computer, at its core, is an electric circuit that 
      takes in only certain kind of inputs. It gives out well-defined
      outputs for each of these inputs. 
      The collection of all valid inputs of a particular circuit, and abstract 
      details of its execution constitute the <strong>Instruction Set Architecture</strong>.

      <span>Definition</span>
      <strong>Instruction set:</strong> The vocabulary of commands understood by an architecture.
   </p>

   <p>
      <span>Definition</span>
      <strong>Stored-program concept:</strong> The idea that instructions and data of many types can be stored in
      memory as numbers and thus be easy to change, leading to the
      stored-program computer.

      <span>Definition</span>
      <strong>Doubleword:</strong>Another natural unit of access in a computer, 
      usually a group of 64 bits; corresponds to the size of a register in the 
      RISC-V architecture.<br><br>
      <strong>Word:</strong>A natural unit of access in a computer, usually a group of 32 bits.
   </p>

   <p>
      <span>Opinion</span>
      The principle behind having just 32 registers is <em>Smaller is Faster.</em> 
      Having 32 registers makes it easier to assign bits to denote registers in the instruction,
      which sounds like a more plausible reason. 
   </p>

   <p>
      <span>Note</span>
      Registers in RISC-V architecture are denoted with <em>x</em> followed
      the number of that register.
   </p>

   <p>
      <span>Definition</span>
      <strong>Data transfer instruction:</strong>A command that moves data between memory and registers.
      <strong>address</strong>A value used to delineate the location of a specific data element
      within a memory array.

      <ol>Overview of instructions read till now:
         <li>
            <span>add rd, rs1, rs2</span>
         </li>
         <li>
            <span>sub rd, rs1, rs2</span>
         </li>
         <li>
            <span>ld r1, i(r2)</span>
            Here, the sum of <span>r2</span> and <span>i</span> forms the memory
            address. <span>ld</span> stands for <em>load doubleword</em>.
            <span>r2</span> and <span>i</span> are called the <em>base register</em> 
            and <em>offset</em>, respectively. 
         </li>
         <li>
            <span>sd r1, i(r2)</span>
            The <span>sd</span>, <em>store doubleword</em>, instruction is 
            the counterpart to <em>load doubleword</em>.
         </li>
      
      </ol>

      <span>Byte addressing</span>
      <img src="assets/byte-addressing.png" alt="image depicting byte-addressing">
      Since 8-bit bytes are useful in many programs, virtually all
      architectures today address individual bytes.Therefore, the
      address of a doubleword matches the address of one of the 8 bytes
      within the doubleword, and addresses of sequential doublewords
      differ by 8.
      Therefore, the address of a doubleword matches the address of 
      one of the 8 bytes within the doubleword, and addresses of sequential 
      doublewords differ by 8.
